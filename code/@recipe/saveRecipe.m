    % Purpose
    % Writes only the core settings to a a defined location. This is used to save modified
    % recipe files for re-use later. i.e. we save only the sample and mosaic fields not 
    % things like the front-left position which are highly sample-specific. The sample ID 
    % is wiped. The purpose of this function is to save a clean recipe for re-use to build
    % a new acquisition.

    % 
    % Outputs
    % success - returns true if the file was written. false otherwise
